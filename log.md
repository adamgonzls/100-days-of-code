# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 09, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Forked the 100 days of code branch, this took much longer than it should have.

**Thoughts:** I was pretty frustrated that it took me longer than I expected to do this routine task. Ultimately, I was able to get the fork done using the link below.

### Day 2: May 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Studied Regular Expressions. (45mins)

**Thoughts**: Today I was trying to solve the FreeCodeCamp "Check for Palindromes" task and ended up spending time reviewing Regular Expressions. I've used them a few times and every time I've used them in production, I've been glad that I went that route. This time I decided I wanted to spend a little more time studying them. I will spend more time on RegexOne later.

### Day 3: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
