# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 09, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Forked the 100 days of code branch, this took much longer than it should have.

**Thoughts:** I was pretty frustrated that it took me longer than I expected to do this routine task. Ultimately, I was able to get the fork done using the link below.

### Day 2: May 10, 2018
##### Regular Expressions and D3

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Studied Regular Expressions (45mins)
2. D3.js (15mins)
3. Studied Regular Expressions (47mins)

**Thoughts**: Today I was trying to solve the FreeCodeCamp "Check for Palindromes" task and ended up spending time reviewing Regular Expressions. I've used them a few times and every time I've used them in production, I've been glad that I went that route. This time I decided I wanted to spend a little more time studying them. I will spend more time on RegexOne later. I finished up "Learn D3.js for free" today, I'll need to get more practice to really do anything with this library.

### Day 3: May 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
1. More Regular Expressions (35mins)

**Thoughts** 
I went through more exercises about regular expressions, now know more about what all the different special characters mean: \d means any digit, . (period) means any character, \w means any alphanumeric character and ? means an optional character.
